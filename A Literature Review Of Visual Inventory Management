1.	Abstract
Todays, there are many establishments that have personal and joint tenancy assets. Reaching information about inventories and assets is very important for establishments. Having these information provides an advantages for elimination of deficiences and productive usage. Many asset management systems that offers change to manage all types of assets  were developed to provide these advantages. These systems are used in establishments like company. Besides they become popular different establishments. Using asset management system in universities makes advantages because of elimination of deficiences and productive usage features. Universities benefit many assets with today’s technologies for reaching qualified person.  Developing an asset management system that instructors and personnels can be got access enhances this qualitiy of education. The aim of this project is designing and making actual user friendly and web based asset management system that visualises floor of Cankaya University with real plans. In this way all instructors, personnels and directors can see all plans  smoothly while they management inventories of Cankaya University.




2.	Introduction
In educational environments there is a number of materials which are allocated in various locations including but not limited to offices, laboratories, classes. These are not uniquely defined and there are inappropriate ways of monitoring the usage/consumption. These conditions create an environment, where optimal management procedures cannot be supported[1]. Provide innovative design solutions that reflect the future needs of technology-based education increase community use of school facilities; maximize value for money, ensure efficient and effective management of new and existing capital assets [2]. This paper, we mentioned asset managment systems, related works and aim of this project. 

3.	Asset Management System
           Asset management system is a dedicated application which is used to record and track an asset throughout its life cycle, from procurement to disposal. It provides an organization with information like where certain assets are located, who is using them, how they are being utilized and details about the asset [3]. The method and system also track the removal and stocking of items through unique identification strings, so that individual access, use, and theft of items can be monitored [4]. In many establishments specially schools assets are registered to paper, listed as tables. In this way getting information about inventories and asstes is time consuming. Also adding new assets and inventories or deleting them is pretty hard. So these systems are used in schools. Developing an inventory management system requires investment in systems and time. However, the advantages are immense, as inventory management puts you in complete control of procuring and maintaining of your assets [5]. In this project benefitting from these advantages is purposed.

4.	Related Works
There are many works and projects about assets management system and analogously inventory management system. Inventory management system involves about selling product, stock etc. But asset management system  is any process a company or organization uses to keep track of the equipment and inventory vital to day-to-day operation of their businesses [6]. For this project, related works about asset management system in schools must be exemplified.
A study has been conducted to design and develop a web-based system that supports material flows and related management processes in educational environments. The proposed system supports standardized handling of the resources in educational settings and structured management of assets and consumables. It consists of an application running on handheld/smartphone that supports record keeping of school materials [1]. The aim of this work was to design and develop a complete information system which will save valuable time for people involved as it will help for the easier, faster and effective inventory and management of assets. 
One another previous study of the asset management system has been done for commercial banks to keep track of their assets.It is an essential tool for them because it provides to get rid of papers trials also they have a software tracking system for assets[8].

Another previous work of the asset management system is “WiseTrack”.It provides to manage and track IT and lab equipment for schools.They also can make a check-in/check out opportunity for an equipment for students.WiseTrack also have asset management systems for many industries like military,government and museum[10].

5.	Infrastructure needs/skills 
The asset management system required two major skills; database and web development.A relational database is the most essential part of the project ,the project  requires a solid database system such as Microsoft SQL Server,Oracle or Sybase[9].Also the system has to keep secure the inventory system to avoid problems.Moreover the asset management system have to be user friendly so the programmer needs UX skills and web development skills to use the system effectively.

6.	Aim of Asset Management System Project
Productive usage of assets will be supplied uber efficient. This contributes to our university with regard to materiality. To achieve the school property track for related personnel to inquire anytime and anywhere, increase property management system transparency[7]. Getting information about assets in a class like if it works or if it broken will be possible. So supply time will become shorter. Because of knowing count and types of assets, determining robbery situations will get easy. With this system university teachers can determine class that is favorable for class’s aim, student’s counts, class’s activitie’s materials easly.  Thus quality of education increases and save time. With this system deficiencies can be determined before academic year and can be supplied easily.




7.	Conclusion
In summary, developing an asset management system requires investment in systems and time. Successful asset and equipment records are all about managing the information that you have about each individual asset in such a way that it can be accessed easily and quickly when the need arises. The traditional method of asset management renders work cumbersome and less efficient[8].Also the user spend less time for tracking the inventory for misplaced assets and it provides a cost savings due to shorter print cycle and increased return on investment (ROI)[9].  With this project, instuctors, personnels and managers can see all plans while they are managing inventories of Cankaya University.
